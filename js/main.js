/*Goal: Create a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
The users should be able to click to place 
their X or O and if they win the program
should mention their win in the DOM. 
Please make the game as OOP as possible.
*/


/* 
step 1: Create the two players
step 2: User interaction (OOP)
    Wh goes first? 
        -traditional, X foes first and other one is assined O
    What happens if X or O wins?
        - If X wins then HTTML playerXscore updates
        -If O wins then playerOscore updates
    What happens if no one wins? 
        -the points get added to html id  Tie 
step 3: Which array patters determine the win?
    If either user gets three in a row:
        [0 1 2]
        [3 4 5]
        [6 7 8]
    Win patterns vertical, horizontal and X
    total win patterns within the array is 8? 
Step 4: if the person wins it should mention thier win in the DOM(document Object model):
    ex: document.write(" play ${playerXwin} won!") idk
Step 5: if theres one player then it shoul duse an API and have a computer play against the user
if i complete the basics on time then integrate step 5 else just simple
